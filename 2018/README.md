# Advent of Code 2018

Each day folder contains an executable `solution` script (the extension depends on the language) which can be used to run the solution,
an `input.txt` file which contains the input,
and an `output.txt` file which contains the output.
All solution scripts read input from `stdin` and write their output to `stdout` in human-readable format.

To run a solution from the project root, use:

```
./solve.sh <day>
```
