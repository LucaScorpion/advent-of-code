# Advent of Code

Each day folder contains a `solution` script, an `input.txt` file which contains the input, and an `output.txt` file which contains the output. All solution scripts read input from `stdin` and write their output to `stdout` in human-readable format.

To run a solution, navigate to a year directory and run:

```sh
./solve.sh <day>
```
